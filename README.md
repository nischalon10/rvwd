# rvwd – React Starter (Vite + React Router)

rvwd is a universal, lightweight feedback platform that turns scattered comments into clear, actionable insight—fast. Create shareable micro-forms in seconds, collect responses anywhere, and get instant signal via concise summaries, simple scoring, and filters by date/keyword. Unlike generic survey tools, rvwd is built for rapid iteration: each form is a living doc you can tweak on the fly (prompt, description, status), and the dashboard gives a cross-form view so you can spot what’s working across products, dishes, classes, or promos. Whether you’re validating a new menu item, a 50% discount offer, or a course module, the same workflow scales across domains. Login, create, share, decide—no heavy setup, just feedback you can act on today.
